The dataset contains `12` CSV files containing sales details for the 12 months of the year 2019. The naming convention is as follows: Sales_[MONTH_NAME]_2019\
Each file contains anywhere from around `9000` to `26000` rows and `6` columns. The columns are as follows:\
`Order ID`,	`Product`, `Quantity Ordered`, `Price Each`, `Order Date`, `Purchase Address`
